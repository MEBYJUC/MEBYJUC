PROJECT INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT
Project Integration Management includes the processes and activities to identify, define, combine, unify, and 
coordinate the various processes and project management activities within the Project Management Process Groups. In 
the project management context, integration includes characteristics of unification, consolidation, communication, and 
interrelationship. These actions should be applied from the start of the project through completion. Project Integration 
Management includes making choices about:

Resource allocation,
Balancing competing demands,
Examining any alternative approaches,
Tailoring the processes to meet the project objectives, and
 Managing the interdependencies among the Project Management Knowledge Areas.

and consolidating them into an integrated project management plan.
4.3 Direct and Manage Project Work—The process of leading and performing the work defined in the project
